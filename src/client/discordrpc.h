// Minimal Discord Rich Presence client.
//
// This talks directly to the local Discord desktop client over its IPC
// pipe/socket using the same lightweight JSON-over-framed-messages
// protocol as Discord's own (now legacy, but still fully supported)
// "discord-rpc" library. No external SDK or extra dependency is needed;
// it only uses jsoncpp (already part of this project) plus plain OS
// sockets/pipes.
//
// IMPORTANT: large_image/small_image below are normally *asset key names*,
// not file paths. To use your own pictures as a key name you first have to:
//   1. Create an application at https://discord.com/developers/applications
//   2. Copy its numeric "Application ID" (this is the client_id below)
//   3. Go to "Rich Presence" -> "Art Assets" and upload your images there,
//      giving each one a short key name (e.g. "mineboostv2_logo")
//   4. Use that key name (not the file) as large_image/small_image here.
// Discord does not accept raw image bytes over the RPC protocol.
//
// Alternatively, a direct "https://..." URL works too for large_image,
// without needing to be pre-uploaded as an Art Asset -- Discord's client
// fetches it itself. This is how the skin face is populated: there's no
// image upload step for that, since it's a different URL per player.
// NOTE: this URL passthrough only works for large_image. small_image
// still requires a pre-uploaded Art Asset key name; passing it a raw URL
// just produces a broken-image placeholder client-side. See the comment
// on updateLargeImage() below.

	// rendering/uploading, without restarting the "elapsed time" counter
	// the way a full setActivity() call with reset_timestamp=true would.
	//
	// IMPORTANT: this project relies on being able to pass a plain
	// "https://..." URL (not a pre-uploaded Art Asset key) so a different
	// image can be shown per player/texture pack. Discord's local IPC
	// SET_ACTIVITY only resolves such raw URLs for `large_image` -- for
	// `small_image` it only accepts a pre-uploaded Art Asset key name and
	// silently shows a broken-image placeholder for anything else. This
	// is a real, confirmed quirk of the classic desktop Rich Presence
	// protocol (unrelated to the newer Embedded App SDK, whose docs
	// mention URL support for both slots -- that's a different, unrelated
	// transport). Practical implication: the skin face URL MUST go in
	// large_image, and any static logo key must go in small_image, not
